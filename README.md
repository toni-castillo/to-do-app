# 📝 To Do App

To Do web application developed with **HTML, CSS/Bootstrap and JavaScript** as practice exercise for the JavaScript and DOM module of the Codehouse Academy bootcamp.

### Functionalities of the app:
- Tasks can be added (and deleted) with three types of priority: normal, intermediate and urgent.
- Each task has an associated colour that will be assigned to it at the time of creation according to its priority.
- Existing tasks can be filtered by their priority through a selection menu that activates the filter each time the option is changed.
- Existing tasks can be searched with a text entry. Search is triggered by each keystroke typed into the search box.
- The app saves the list of all available tasks both in the app and in localStorage.
